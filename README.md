# dots - simply my config files

![bgen static-main]
![bgen git-lcommit]
![bgen git-license]

I don't have much to say about it, to summarize:

```rust
fn dots() {
    let mut distro = "arch linux";
    let mut wm = "hyprland";
    let mut shell = "fish";
    let mut terminal = "foot";
    let mut editor = "neovim";
    let mut theme = "rose-pine";
}
```
